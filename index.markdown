Hey, ðŸ‘‹ I'm Andriy! Currently a PhD student at Carleton University supervised by Dr. Yuhong Guo.
My research interest is Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Model-based RL, Robotics and Cybernetics.

For my full time job, I work at National Research Council of Canada. I received my Masters degree in Computer Science from University of New Brunswick where I was supervised by Dr. Scott Buffett. In my [thesis](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-47358-7_8) I extended Sequential Rule Mining to the online case. I received my Hon. B.Sc. with major in Computer Science and minor in Mathematics from University of Toronto.
